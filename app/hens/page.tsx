          <p><strong>Feeding:</strong> Layer feed 16-18% protein for laying hens, starter feed 20-24% for chicks, grower feed 16-20% for pullets, fresh water 24/7 (1 gallon per 4 birds), grit for free-range birds, calcium supplements (oyster shell)</p>
          <p><strong>Eggs:</strong> Laying age 18-24 weeks depending on breed, peak production 6 months to 2 years, average 250-300 eggs/year, daylight affects laying (14+ hours optimal), collect twice daily to prevent brooding</p>
          <p><strong>Breeds:</strong> Rhode Island Red (hardy, good layers), Leghorn (white eggs, prolific), Buff Orpington (docile, cold-hardy), Australorp (black, excellent layers), Sussex (dual-purpose, friendly)</p>
          <p><strong>Management:</strong> Proper ventilation without drafts, deep litter method or weekly cleaning, treats max 10% of diet (vegetables, fruits - no chocolate/avocado/onions), social animals preferring flocks of 3+, 5-10 year lifespan</p>

          <h3>🥚 Breeding & Hatching</h3>
          <p><strong>Natural Breeding:</strong> Rooster to hen ratio 1:8-12 (heavy breeds) or 1:10-15 (light breeds), fertile eggs develop after 7 days of mating, broody hen sits 21 days, provide quiet safe nesting area away from flock</p>
          <p><strong>Artificial Incubation:</strong> 21-day period exactly, temperature 99.5°F (37.5°C) forced air or 101°F still air, humidity 55-60% days 1-18 then 65-70% days 19-21, turn eggs 3-5 times daily until day 18, stop turning day 18</p>
          <p><strong>Chick Care:</strong> Brooder temperature 95°F first week then reduce 5°F weekly until 70°F, chick starter feed 20-24% protein and clean water in shallow containers, non-slip flooring (paper towels first week), 24-hour light first 48 hours</p>
          <p><strong>Hatching Process:</strong> Pip (first hole) day 19-20, zip (cutting around shell) day 20-21, full hatch by day 21, don't help unless absolutely necessary, chicks can survive 48-72 hours without food/water after hatching</p>
          <p><strong>Brooder Setup:</strong> 1 sq ft per chick first 2 weeks, increase to 2 sq ft by 6 weeks, heat lamp or brooder plate, draft-free but ventilated, waterer and feeder appropriate for chick size</p>

          <p><strong>Egg Production:</strong> Good layers producing 180-200 medium-sized brown eggs per year, start laying at 20-24 weeks, continue laying well into winter, eggs have rich orange yolks from foraging, excellent for baking and cooking</p>
          <p><strong>Breeding & Temperament:</strong> Excellent mothers with strong broody tendency, will hatch and raise their own chicks naturally, protective of young but calm with humans, roosters are gentle and good flock protectors, good fertility rates 85-90%</p>
          <p><strong>Health & Longevity:</strong> Hardy breed with natural disease resistance, fewer respiratory issues than commercial breeds, live 8-12 years with proper care, slower growth means stronger bones and better overall health</p>
          <p><strong>Conservation Status:</strong> Rare heritage breed helping preserve genetic diversity, listed as threatened by livestock conservancy, slower growth than commercial breeds (16-20 weeks to processing), excellent meat quality with superior flavor</p>

          <h3>🏥 Health & Medicine</h3>
          <p><strong>Common Issues:</strong> Respiratory infections from drafts/dust/ammonia, external parasites (mites, lice, fleas), internal parasites (roundworms, tapeworms, coccidia), egg binding in laying hens, bumblefoot from rough/wet surfaces, sour crop from spoiled food</p>
          <p><strong>Prevention Protocol:</strong> Clean coop weekly with deep clean monthly using disinfectant, fresh dry bedding (pine shavings, straw, sand), quarantine new birds 30 days minimum, proper nutrition with complete feed, clean fresh water changed daily</p>
